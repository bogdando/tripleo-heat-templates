    `IronicConductorGroupName` allows to define an Ironic Conductor Group so
    that the managed baremetal nodes may be later manually distributed by
    operators across multiple conductors. By default,
    `IronicConductorGroupName` takes an empty value, which creates no
    conductor groups associated with the given Ironic Conductor service
    instance.
